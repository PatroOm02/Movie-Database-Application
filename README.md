## üîë Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher** (e.g., from OpenJDK, Adoptium, Oracle).
* **Apache Maven 3.6+**
* **An Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or Ultimate is highly recommended as the instructions below are tailored for it.
* **TMDB API Key:**
    1.  Go to [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create a free account.
    2.  Navigate to your account settings and then to the "API" section.
    3.  Request a new API key (Developer/v3 API).
    4.  Keep this API key handy, as you will need to insert it into the application code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download):**
    If you're using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace with your repository URL if applicable
    cd MovieDatabaseApp
    ```
    If you downloaded a ZIP:
    Unzip the project to your desired location.

2.  **Open in IntelliJ IDEA:**
    * Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    * Select `File` > `Open` and navigate to the `MovieDatabaseApp` project folder.
    * IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect the `pom.xml` file and configure the project as a Maven project.

3.  **Maven Re-import:**
    * After opening the project, it's a good practice to force a Maven re-import.
    * In IntelliJ IDEA, open the **Maven Tool Window** (usually on the right side).
    * Click the **"Reimport All Maven Projects"** icon (a circular arrow).

4.  **Configure TMDB API Key:**
    * Navigate to `src/main/java/com/username/moviesapp/service/TmdbApiService.java` (replace `com.username.moviesapp` with your actual package name).
    * Locate the line:
        ```java
        String API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
        ```
    * **Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual TMDB API key** obtained from the prerequisites step.
    * Save the file.

5.  **Clean and Rebuild Project:**
    * In the Maven Tool Window, under your project name, expand "Lifecycle."
    * **Double-click `clean`**.
    * After `clean` finishes, go to the IntelliJ IDEA menu bar: **`Build` > `Rebuild Project`**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

After completing the setup:

1.  **Using Maven (Recommended for JavaFX applications):**
    * In the **Maven Tool Window** (IntelliJ IDEA).
    * Under your project name, expand "Plugins."
    * Expand `javafx`.
    * **Double-click `javafx:run`**.

    This will launch the application window.
